# TriCast

Vesicast Weather provides reliable five-day weather data in three hour increments because hourly forecasts are excessive and that API option is cost prohibitive to our valued customers!

## tl;dr (Getting Started)

Drag the live map marker anywhere in the window for the current weather description, high and low temperatures, humidity, wind speed, direction, and gust speed.
use the search bar to enter a location to update the weather data.
