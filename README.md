# TriCast

One paragraph project description goes here. If more explanation is needed, divide up into smaller chunks and add below.

## tl;dr (Getting Started)

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

(Quick installation and running instructions)

### Prerequisites

```
With examples
```

### Installing

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Testing

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detailed information.

### Communication

Even if you don't want to work on the project yourself, you can help out a lot just by reporting any bugs you find or enhancements you want to see added!

Head over to [GitHub's issue tracker](https://github.com/your/project/issues) to submit a bug report or let us know about a feature request!

### Source Control

We use the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow) for managing the source code. So if you want to contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request and be prepared to discuss your additions! :)

### Code Guidelines

If you're adding lots of new code for your feature or bug fix, be sure that it passes linting (we use [Airbnb's JavaScript style guidelines and linting presets](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)) and contains plenty of comments explaining _why_ your code is written the way it is.

If your code doesn't pass through the linter error-free, that's okay! (I've failed plenty of tests, and teachers have _usually_ given me a second chance!) Just make sure your code is commented and give a brief explanation of why linting fails when you submit your pull request. We'll be happy to work with you to get it all figured out.
